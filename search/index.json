[{"content":"Hello, Namastey!\rSpreading Knowledge, Sharing Happiness\nFascinated by the ancient art of Vedic Kundli, I started learning Vedic astrology 5 years ago to discover how wonderful, accurate, and excellent explorers our sages were, who calculated and predicted our lives based on planetary positions up there in the sky and their deep impacts on our lives.\nIn my journey of learning, I would like to share the knowledge I have gained, as and when I can, and spread this ancient art.\nI would also love to help people in whatever small ways I could—whether by providing astrology analysis or by being a friend, a listener, a support, or a coach to help them face the challenges that life brings. I want to share happiness and help bring smiles to people’s faces.\nLife is a journey filled with ups and downs, and I believe that with a little guidance and support, we can all find our way to peace and joy. Let’s walk this path together, hand in hand, and create a brighter tomorrow.\nWith warmth and gratitude\nAshwini\n","date":"2025-03-03T21:13:21+05:30","permalink":"https://happiness-mantra.in/p/my-first-post/","title":"My First Post"}]
